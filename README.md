If you can contribute well-written and solid code using project standards for something that a project needs
in it's main-line:

0. Fork the project on GitHub <https://github.com/roylaurie>.
1. Review the code-base.
2. Introduce yourself and your idea on the email-group <roylauriesoftware@googlegroups.com>.
3. Make your changes.
4. Announce when you're ready for review on the email-group.
5. The Process: Review, Request, Fix, Review, Accept; repeat if necessary.
6. Request a pull from the reviewer on GitHub. 
7. Your code will be eventually merged into main-line and your name listed as an author.

Requirements:
* Follow the style standard that is apparent throughout the code-base.
* New code should come with new unit-tests or unit-test fixes.
* Read the project README fully and agree to donate your code under the SubComm (3bsd) license.

Also, you are more than welcome to start your own project from existing code and do whatever
you like with it - it's free software.
